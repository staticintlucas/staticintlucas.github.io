# Hi

My name is Lucas and I am an electronic and software engineer from Cork, Ireland. I have a master's
degree in Electrical and Electronic engineering, and I currently work on embedded software at
Qualcomm.

- I know C, Python, (some) C++, a bit of Rust, and a couple of flavours of assembly.
- I'm constantly working on some random project. I eventually end up losing interest in most, but
it's a habit I'm trying *really* hard to break.
- I work on pretty much everything hardware or low-level software, but I get often scared by
anything web related. I did make this website though, so that's something.
